In the first chapters, our heroes defined the central players - the User, Clinic, Appointment
and more that would embark on adventures together. Sketches and
schematics in hand, they began mapping relations between characters. Meanwhile,
others prepared the stage, designing sturdy tables to safely hold details as the plot
thickened.
Now we approach pivotal scenes where limitations are tested and functions
formed. Primary users log in to begin their journeys, while assistants encounter
tailored menus for their roles. Through it all, an API provides vital support, ensuring
times remain true to real clinics.
Of course, such an epic undertaking requires the steeliest of managers. Tasks
are portioned according to the sacred Fibonacci pattern, and codes are firmly tied
to their duties on our quest board. Each new build promises richer experiences for
all involved.
Stay tuned, curiouscrew, for more installments from this lively production! Our
troupe works with dedication to deliver quality care - and a ripping good yarn - for
their audiences. This writer looks forward to sharing their further adventures!
